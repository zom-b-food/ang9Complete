  <h2>Welcome to the Customers Ang9 App</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6 panel">
      <p>This is the <strong>Home Component</strong> which is actually quite simple. Clicking the "Customers" link will
        take you to the customers section which not so simple as it's over-engineered in the typical Angular way. :)</p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong, however. It's not nearly as over-engineered as, say, React! Now that's a real headache!
      </p>
      <p>I
        could have
        done this entire app in java/jsp in half the time and half the code. But, whatever, right? This is what everyone
        wants nowadays, so we all just need to quit fussing about it and get on board.</p>
      <p>Until next month when something
        else is <em>the best way ever</em> to build a webapp.
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, I hope you like it. And feel free to download it on <a target="_blank"
